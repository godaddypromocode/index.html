At all times, you will want to ensure that your domain name and hosting accounts serve you in the best possible way. But before we discuss how you can transfer your name to from GoDaddy, let's first discuss what it is and why people do it.\r\n\r\n## Godaddy Promo: What It Is\r\n\r\nDomain transfer is the process of changing the registrar of your domain name. Let's assume that when you bought your domain name, you did it through name name.com. However, you might have reached a point where you say that you want to transfer it to GoDaddy. This means that next time you are renewing the domain registration, you will renew it with GoDaddy and not name.com. It is important that you realize that this is totally different from simply pointing a domain which is something from another day.\r\n\r\n## 2017 Promo Codes: Why Do It\r\n\r\nYou might be wondering why you should do such a thing.\r\n\r\nDiscounts: the reason why GoDaddy domain transfer is quite popular is because people with existing accounts find it cheaper to renew their accounts when the expiration time comes. For example, if you made a mistake of buying a domain name for $30, and then you come and realize that you can renew that domain name with GoDaddy at a lower price, you'll be doing yourself a favor if you transferred your domain to GoDaddy.\r\n\r\nAnother reason why people transfer domains is so as to separate their hosting and domain registration accounts. If you signed up with dreamhost and hosted with them but feel that you are putting all your eggs in one basket, then you can transfer your domain to GoDaddy and maintain your account with dreamhost.\r\n\r\n## Godaddy Promotional Codes: How To Do It\r\n\r\nGo to your registrar and unlock the domain under the administration of the domain. Look for the authorization code; this is what shows that you really own that domain, and it is a must-go-through step for any GoDaddy domain transfer.\r\n\r\nThe next step is going to the GoDaddy homepage and then purchasing the domain transfer after which you will receive an authorization code from them. From there they will provide you with a link and you will just follow the step by step process. It's that simple.\r\n\r\nChoosing the right hosting or domain registrar can be quite difficult. If you would like to get started with GoDaddy, you should start the GoDaddy domain transfer now.\r\n\r\n**Article Source:** [http://EzineArticles.com/4646366](http://EzineArticles.com/4646366)",
